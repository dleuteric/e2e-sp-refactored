title: Communications Latency Analysis

description: |
  Data age analysis comparing ground and onboard processing latency.
  Shows p50, p90, and mean latency for both processing modes.

# KPI Mapping (for trade-off tool)
kpi_mapping:
  primary_metric: "Ground Processing p50 [ms]"
  higher_is_better: false  # Lower latency is better
  thresholds:
    excellent: 100     # < 100ms = excellent responsiveness
    good: 1000         # < 1s = acceptable
    marginal: 10000    # < 10s = marginal
